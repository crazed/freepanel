Current prereqs:
Config::General
Net::SSH2
DNS::ZoneParse

Quick notes:
- need to setup ssh keys in advance
- need to give your management user sudo access with NOPASSWD option
- basically connects to all servers in config file and runs one of the helper scripts

Completed:
- cluster management over ssh
- Apache module
- run_cmd helper allows basic root command execution, useful for software installs

Todo:
- finish porting NSD module and other useful modules from master -> refactor
- a cron modification system
